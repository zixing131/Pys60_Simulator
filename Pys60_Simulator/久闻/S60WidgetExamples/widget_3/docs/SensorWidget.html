<hr />
<h3><strong>About this document</strong></h3>
<p>This document describes the Sensor Widget application for Nokia Symbian^3 SDK. Target audience are developers developing sensor applications and using other run-time environment interested in sensor service API. </p>
<h3><strong>About this Product</strong></h3>
<p>Widgets are lightweight Web applications developed using the same well-known   standards-based Web technologies &ndash; AJAX, CSS, HTML and JavaScript &ndash; used to   create Web pages. Developers can use it as a reference and testers can use it to   test the relevant functionality. This widget is intended for Nokia Symbian^3 SDK. Developers should be able to develop professional applications.</p>
<h3><strong>Product intent</strong></h3>
<p>Example Widget Application is designed to run on Nokia Symbian^3 SDK. It will   be designed such that a developer takes it as a reference to create useful   applications for any functionality supported on SDK. It will be designed to let   the testers to test the functionality</p>
<h3><strong>Product limitations</strong></h3>
<p>Example widget is not intended to give full featured implementation. This   example will implement the Sensor Service APIs. It gives only sensor   functionalities.</p>
<h3><strong>Specification</strong></h3>
<p>The example widget uses the WRT 1.0 API. The Web Runtime (WRT) environment   supports the following Internet technology standards:<br />
    <br />
  HTML 4.01<br />
  The   basic HTML standards are supported.<br />
  <br />
  XHTML 1.0<br />

  CSS Level 2 revision 1 (CSS   2.1)<br />
  <br />
  JavaScript 1.5 (ECMA-262 3rd Edition) <br />
  The standard JavaScript   features are supported. The WRT environment also provides some additional   features that are mobile device specific. <br />
  The following additional   JavaScript features are supported in the WRT environment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Utilizing the underlying user input features of the mobile device to   interact with the user </li>
  <li>Self-updating widgets </li>
  <li>UI navigation using either a cursor or tabs </li>
  <li>Rotating the screen: portrait and landscape orientation </li>
  <li>Launching Symbian mobile applications </li>
  <li>Localization framework with automatic detection of the device language   settings </li>
  <li>Getting information on physical device functionality and controlling such   features. </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Example Description</strong></h3>
<p>The SensorWidget demonstrates service APIs for Sensors. Sensor Service API provides access to the various methods provided by S60  sensor channel subsystem. These include finding available sensor channels,  registering to receive notification on data from various sensors or channel  property changes and setting and getting channel properties.</p>
<p>Sensor channel provides abstraction of various physical sensors  that exist in the device. The user can map data from one physical sensor to  several channels. </p>
<h3><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>
<p>Widget gives following fuctionalities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Find Sensor Channel(s).</li>
  <li>Register  to receive a notification when a channel property is changed</li>
  <li>Stop  listening to any previously registered notification(s)</li>
  <li>Get  sensor channel properties</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>User Interface</strong></h3>
<p>1. Use the file - Open option to open the widget under   &lt;Installed_SDK_Dir&gt;\examples\widget\SensorWidget.wgz.</p>
<p><img src="docfiles/srw.jpg"/><br /></p>
<p>2. Go to Application folder and click on the SensorWidget to start. Once   you start the widget, it will ask your application permission to access data and   then start the application.</p>
